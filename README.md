# Ikaros

## en-US

This project is intended to build an AI girlfriend, though I'm not sure when I will start implementing it.

## zh-CN

一直说要弄个AI女友，今天（2022/2/14）算是新建文件夹了😂。大一就说要弄，到现在machine learning都还没学，希望研究生上完之前能写完🤷‍♂️

*PS：今天是情人节，希望这个项目以后能派上用场👀*
*PPS：名字叫Ikaros是因为天降之物的女主叫伊卡洛斯*

## changelog

### 202/2/14

It's another Valentine's Day and I haven't made any progress yet, but some good things are happening:

1. I'm taking a machine learning course this semester at CMU.
2. ChatGPT is wonderful and I maybe implement my AI girlfriend using a similar model, but I'm not sure if I have enough money to build such a complex model, maybe using OpenAI's API is more plausible.

Anyway, I promise to write some code before or at next Valentine's Day😂.
